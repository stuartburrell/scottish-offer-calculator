# Scottish offer calculator

This simple interactive web app is meant to assist Scottish home-buyers when
choosing how much to offer on a property.

It allows you to enter your purchase details, and see the total amount of cash you need
at a variety of offers, broken down into different categories such as deposit, legal fees, LBTT and
money for "offers over".

The app is deployed and available at [https://scottish-offer-calculator.streamlit.app/](https://scottish-offer-calculator.streamlit.app/).
